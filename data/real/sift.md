# Sift1B Datasets and Queries 

## Dataset
The Sift1B dataset [1,2] consists of 1 billion SIFT vectors of size 128
representing image feature descriptions.

## Queries

### Lernaean Hydra 2 [3]: queries_orig100_sift_len128_znorm_bin
This is a set of 100 queries selected randomly from the original query workload
that comes with the sift1b dataset.

### Controlled Queries: queries_ctrl100_sift_len128_znorm_bin
This is a set of 100 queries generated by adding progressively larger amounts of
noise to data series extracted from the dataset.

### Random Queries: queries_size100_sift_len128_znorm_bin
This is a set of 100 queries selected randomly from the original dataset beyond the first 
500 million series.
